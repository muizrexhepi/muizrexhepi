Hi, I’m Muiz Rexhepi from Macedonia.
I’m a full-stack developer with 4 years of experience building web applications using Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I use tools like Zustand and React Context for state management. I enjoy developing applications that run smoothly, are easy to maintain, and provide a good experience for users.
